# CodeBackyard

Backyard of different codes and all the wonders (from tiny to huge ones)! :D

# TODO

- [ ] tidy this file :sweat-smile:
- [x] json
- [x] multiprocessing `do_parallel`
- [ ] programming lessons, e.g. hello-world, data structures, ...
- [x] multiprocessing `master`/`worker`/`logger` architecture
- [ ] auction simulations, e.g. second price auction based on historical data
- [ ] string similarity, e.g. embed in N^d then compare
- [ ] homogeneous data splitting, e.g. test/control with homogeneous mean features
- [ ] jupyter notebook resource monitoring, e.g. print memory and cpu usage
- [ ] many p-values permutation estimation
- [ ] sanic/hug rest api examples with bearer authentication
- [ ] p-values and p-hacking
- [ ] non-parameteric statistical inference
- [ ] Blackjack Simulation
- [ ] python-c++-cuda trio! -> solving large dynamic programmings (real-world problem: recursive relations in dynamic pricing)
