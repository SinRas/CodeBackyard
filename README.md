# CodeBackyard

Backyard of different codes and all the wonders (from tiny to huge ones)! :D

# TODO
- [ ] tidy this file :sweat-smile:

## Python Programming: Introductory
- [ ] programming lessons, e.g. hello-world, data structures, ...
- [x] json
- [x] multiprocessing `do_parallel`
- [ ] sanic/hug rest api examples with bearer authentication -> handy codes evey now and then

## Python Mini Modules
- [x] multiprocessing `master`/`worker`/`logger` architecture
- [ ] jupyter notebook resource monitoring, e.g. print memory and cpu usage per notebook

## Simulations
- [ ] auction simulations, e.g. second price auction based on historical data -> demonstrate different levels of abstractions and speed
- [ ] Blackjack Simulation -> fun

## String Similarity (loved to publish paper)
- [ ] string similarity, e.g. embed in N^d then compare -> motivation: exact pairwise-comparison of huge number of strings, e.g. around 100M strings

## Data Science & Statistics
- [ ] homogeneous data splitting, e.g. test/control with homogeneous mean features
- [ ] estimating p-values via permutations
- [ ] p-hacking demonstrated -> there finally will be some statistics which seems significant
- [ ] non-parameteric statistical inference -> confidence sets, ... following book "All of Nonparameteric Statistics"
- [ ] python-c++-cuda trio! -> solving large dynamic programmings (real-world problem: recursive relations in dynamic pricing)
