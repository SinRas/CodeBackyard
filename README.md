Backyard of different codes and all the wonders (from tiny to huge ones)! :D

- [x] json
- [x] multiprocessing `do_parallel`
- [ ] programming lessons, e.g. hello-world, data structures, ...
- [ ] multiprocessing `master`/`worker`/`logger` architecture
- [ ] auction simulations, e.g. second price auction based on historical data
- [ ] string similarity, e.g. embed in N^d then compare
- [ ] homogeneous data splitting, e.g. test/control with homogeneous mean features
- [ ] jupyter notebook resource monitoring, e.g. print memory and cpu usage
